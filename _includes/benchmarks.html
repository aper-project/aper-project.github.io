      We set up two sets of compar-ative experiments to illustrate the effectiveness of Aper. There are three available tools (Lint,ARPDroid,RevDroid) can detect Type-1 ARP misuse bugs, while only Lint can detectType-2 bugs. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To compare their detecting results, if Lint reports a dangerous API missing permission checks (or RV checks), we treat it a Type-1 (or Type-2) bug warning; if ARPDroid inserts permission management statements on the calling context of a dangerous API,we regard it detects a Type-1 bug; we consider RevDroid detects a Type-1 bug, if it reports an unhandled permission revocation on a dangerous API call.

      We compare these tools with Aper, according to their:
    </p>
    <p>
      1: True positive (TP): For a buggy version, detected it as buggy
    </p>
    <p>
      2: True negative (TN): For a patched version, no warning is reported
    </p>
    <p>
      3: False positive (FP): For a patched version, detected it as buggy
    </p>
    <p>
      4: False negative (FN): For a buggy version, no warning is reported
